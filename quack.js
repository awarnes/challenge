/**
 * Question:
 * A quack is a data structure combining properties of both stacks and queues.
 * It can be viewed as a list of elements written left to right such that 
 * three operations are possible:
 * - push(x): add a new item x to the left end of the list
 * - pop(): remove and return the item on the left end of the list
 * - pull(): remove the item on the right end of the list
 * 
 * Implement quack using JS data structures
 * 
 * Bonus: implement the methods such that they take O(1) constant time.
